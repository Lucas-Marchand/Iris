## Setup
To run this project:
1.) Download the Iris.ipynb
2.) Start your Jupyter Notebook using anaconda prompt and 'Jupyter notebook'
3.) Load Iris.ipynb into Jupyter Notebook
4.) Run and execute code block by block or entire file, it will access dataset within the notebook

## Motivations
I wanted to learn more about Sklearn and how to further my 
ability to do exploratory data analysis. This would also be
a great time to learn how to implement several models to 
determine their viability for the given business problem.
The tururial I followed was from Jason Brownlee
(https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/)
and gave me great insight into how some machine learning specialists
are exploring data and how I can use this in my future projects when
I go to explore different datasets.
